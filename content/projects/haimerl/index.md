### Rebuilding of haimerl.at

TODO: picture of landing page

The wineyard Haimerl needed a redesign of there Homepage. The focus of the new website should be on there webshop and make it easier for customers to buy there products.

I was aproached by the designer to implement the design and deploy the newly built website. The redesign of the website was manly on the shop pages and making the cart work without refetching the whole page. There was already a running website built on wordpress, so the changes were implementet on the basis of the existing website.
