## Redesign of haimerl.at

I was responsible for the implemantation of the new design for the onlineshop of the wineyard Haimerl. The main work was to implement a asynchronosly working shopping cart so the user can add, update and remove products.
The website was already exsiting and was using WordPress as a CMS and running an onlineshop with Woocommerce. The design tweaks to the existing homepage were made using CSS. For the asyncronous shopping cart I used only basic JavaScript - importing a new libary would not have been necessary for this task.
