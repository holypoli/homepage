## Design and Implemantation

Digital Architects is a small architecture office from Vienna. They needed a fast and clean looking website for there porfolio. It should be able to use it for presenting there products at the clients and also for further information after meetings.
Since the project needed to be finished in a short timeframe I used GatsbyJS as a static site generator and also implemented all the content myself.

Used Technologies:

- GatsbyJS
- React
- GraphQl
